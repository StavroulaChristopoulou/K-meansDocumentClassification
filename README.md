# K-meansDocumentClassification
Document-vector representation, Classifies documents with K-means method, tf-idf

Cluster documents in multiple categories based on tags, topics, and the content of the document. This is a very standard classification problem and k-means is a highly suitable algorithm for this purpose. The initial processing of the documents is needed to represent each document as a vector and uses term frequency to identify commonly used terms that help classify the document. The document vectors are then clustered to help identify similarity in document groups
